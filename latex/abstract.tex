\textbf{ \large Efficiency evaluation of crossover operators in genetic programming } \\

This thesis represents an overview of genetic operators, focusing specifically on the crossover operators. Along with description of every crossover operator, it summarizes results of so far conducted efficiency evaluation experiments. In scope of this thesis, genetic programming effieciency is examined considering the choices of specific crossover operators, solving the three most common problems in genetic programming: symbolic regression, search of logical functions and evolution of programs.

\textbf{Keywords}: genetic programming, crossover operators, evolution of logical functions, symbolic regression, program evolution, machine learning
